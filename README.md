# repro-build

`repro-build` is a script that helps you build bit-for-bit reproducible
containers. By "reproducible containers", we refer to container images which can
be rebuilt at any time, anywhere, from the same **Dockerfile** and **build
environment**, and be bit-for-bit equal to the original container image.

`repro-build` cannot assist you if your Dockerfile has sources of
non-determinism in it. What it does though is help you with the second part of
the equation, which is providing you with a build environment that is consistent
across Operating Systems and container engines.

> [!TIP]
> You can find some tools to make your container images reproducible in

To demonstrate why reproducibly building a container image requires more than a
"deterministic" Dockerfile, here's an example. Let's build the `scratch` image,
arguably the most deterministic image possible, with Docker and Podman:

```console
$ echo "FROM scratch" | docker build -

```

You can see that the image digests are different. That's not due to the contents
of the image (there are none after all), but due to the different types of
manifests and annotations that Podman and Docker use.

To make the digests exactly the same, you need to control various aspects of the
environment. `repro-build` saves you time by doing just that. Not only that, but
we have a nightly job which ensures that `repro-build` will continue to do so
for future versions of Docker, Podman, and BuildKit.

## How it works

In a nutshell, `repro-build` builds your container using a pinned version of
[BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit), and its reproducibility features.
If you use Docker, it creates a new buildx builder under the hood with a pinned
BuildKit version. If you are using Podman, it runs BuildKit within a container.
Then, it builds your container image, and stores it in tarball format. You can
analyze the image tarball later on and ensure it has the digest you expect.

## Features

- Uses a pinned BuildKit version under the hood, but you can also provide your
  own image
  * Note that the script is currently tested against BuildKit v0.19.0 and
    v0.20.0.
- Accepts
  [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/docs/build-repro.md#source_date_epoch)
  either explicitly, or from an ISO datetime
- Passes `rewrite-timestamp=true` to BuildKit, so that image layers have files
  with a predictable timestamp
- Disables provenance creation, which conflicts with reproducibility
- Tested against various versions of Podman and Docker
- Can run in rootless mode (Podman-only)
- Supports a dry-run mode which prints the commands that would run

As you can see, `repro-build` is a convenient wrapper over BuildKit. It doesn't
add any new features of each own, which means you can also run it once to check
the underlying commands, and use them in your project.

### Build and push a container image on GitHub Actions

Here's how you can reproducibly build and push a container image via GitHub
actions:

```yaml
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
  with:
    driver-opts: image=moby/buildkit:v0.19.0@sha256:14aa1b4dd92ea0a4cd03a54d0c6079046ea98cd0c0ae6176bdd7036ba370cbbe

- name: Reproducibly build and push image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  with:
    provenance: false
    build-args: SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1677619260
    outputs: type=registry,name=...,rewrite-timestamp=true
```

### Analyze a container image in .tar format

You can inspect the created tarball with:

```console
$ ./repro-build analyze image.tar
The OCI tarball contains an index and 1 manifest(s):

Image digest: sha256:d2ed9626c60a7ea2b774b1e268ba74f1839de34808ed32ff99f9f7facde4de0b

## Tarball format

By default, `repro-build` uses the
[`docker` exporter](https://docs.docker.com/build/exporters/) when creating an
image tarball.

Pros and cons of `docker` exporter:
* :+1: The image manifest produced by the `docker` exporter matches the one that
  BuildKit produces when pushing an image to a Docker Registry. In layman terms,
  this means that the `docker` exporter allows you to compare local digests with
  remote ones.
* :-1: You cannot build multi-platform tarballs

Pros and cons of `oci` exporter:
* :+1: You can build multi-platform tarballs, which you can load with Podman
* :-1: Tarballs in `oci` format cannot be consumed by `docker load`

We feel it's more important to compare local digests with remote ones, as well
as load the container image with `docker load`, so we prefer to use the `docker
load` exporter.

## Multi-platform images

If you are on macOS / Windows, the easiest way to build multi-platform images is
via Docker, which has built-in BuildKit support. Any other option may require
nested virtualization to work.

The `docker` exporter that `repro-build` uses under the hood does not support
multi-platform images. You are advised to create a tarball per architecture, if
you want to reproduce an image.

If you want to build and push an image, it's best to swap `type=docker` with
`type=registry` manually. You can try out a build with `./repro-build build
--dry ...`, and tweak the commands that would have ran.

If you want to build and push images with Podman, you may also need to mount the
registry credentials in the BuildKit container.

## Sources of non-determinism

Here are some lesser known sources of non-determinism that we have encountered
while building images:

* `COPY` commands in containerized Buildkit may work differently than `COPY`
  commands in Docker. We have seen permissions changing from `drwxr-xr-x` to
  `drwxr-sr-x`.
* Using datetimes in your commands without specifying a timezone may work for
  the region you're at, but not in a different country.
* Adding a user to the container image means that an entry is added in
  `/etc/shadow`. This entry contains the day the user was first added, which
  means that such images are not reproducible the next day. We suggest appending
  `&& chage -d 99999 <user> && rm /etc/shadow-` in your `adduser` command.
* If you attempt to copy `/etc` during image creation to a different place, you
  may also copy the mounted `/etc/resolv.conf` file, which contains info about
  your DNS resolvers.

## Other considerations

* The arguments you pass to the script must be tracked somehow, if you want to
  rebuild your container image in the future. Best way to track them is in your
  Git repo. Else, you may want to add them in your tag, or as labels.
